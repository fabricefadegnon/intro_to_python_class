"""
An infinite iterator is an iterator that never ends, meaning that it will 
continue to produce elements indefinitely.

Here is an example of how to create an infinite iterator in Python using the 
count() function from the itertools module,


"""
from itertools import count

# create an infinite iterator that starts at 1 and increments by 1 each time
infinite_iterator = count(1)

# print the first 5 elements of the infinite iterator
for i in range(5):
    print(next(infinite_iterator))
