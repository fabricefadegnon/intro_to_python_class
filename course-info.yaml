title: Introduction to Python for Data Science
language: English
summary: "<p>This is an introductory Python course by Petacube Inc. \nThe presented\
  \ materials are based on the official <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/\">Python\
  \ Documentation</a>. The target audience are the people with little or no experience\
  \ in programming who would like to start learning Python.</p>\n<p>In this course,\
  \ you will learn about the basics, such as variables and operations with them, strings\
  \ and other data structures, boolean operators, conditions, control flow, and so\
  \ on. You will try implementing loops, functions, and classes, as well as using\
  \ parts of your code as imported modules, and working with text files.</p>\n<p>Have\
  \ fun and good luck!. We will teach you about modern data science stack, which includes\
  \ libraries such as numpy, pandas, networkx, matplotlib, scipy etc</p>"
