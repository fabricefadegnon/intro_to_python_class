problem #1 palindrome
---------------------------
A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same
backward and forward
for example:
Too bad—I hid a boot
“racecar,
“kayak

- write code that checks if string is a palindrome

------------------------------------
problem #2 score of the string
-----------------------------------
You are given a string s. The score of a string is defined as the sum of the absolute
difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters.

Return the score of s.
Note
-----
a function that will return ascii number for chacter is ord
# Convert character to ASCII code
char = 'A'
ascii_code = ord(char)
print("ASCII code of", char, "is", ascii_code)

will print 65

a function that will return absolute difference between two numbers is abs
eg abs(40-65) = 25

Example 1:

Input: s = "hello"

Output: 13

Explanation:

The ASCII values of the characters in s are: 'h' = 104, 'e' = 101, 'l' = 108, 'o' = 111. So, the score of s would be |104 - 101| + |101 - 108| + |108 - 108| + |108 - 111| = 3 + 7 + 0 + 3 = 13.

Example 2:

Input: s = "zaz"

Output: 50

Explanation:

The ASCII values of the characters in s are: 'z' = 122, 'a' = 97. So, the score of s would be |122 - 97| + |97 - 122| = 25 + 25 = 50.



Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of lowercase English letters.

------------------------------------------------
problem #3  Defang IP address
Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.

A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".


Example 1:

Input: address = "1.1.1.1"
Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"
Example 2:

Input: address = "255.100.50.0"
Output: "255[.]100[.]50[.]0"


Constraints:

The given address is a valid IPv4 address.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
problem #4 Shuffle a string
You are given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length. The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.

Return the shuffled string.



Example 1:
Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abc", indices = [0,1,2]
Output: "abc"
Explanation: After shuffling, each character remains in its position.


Constraints:

s.length == indices.length == n
1 <= n <= 100
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
0 <= indices[i] < n
All values of indices are unique.
