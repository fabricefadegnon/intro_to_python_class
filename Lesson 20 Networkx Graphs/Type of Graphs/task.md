By definition, a Graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) 
along with identified pairs of nodes (called edges, links, etc). In NetworkX, nodes can be any hashable object e.
g., a text string, an image, an XML object, another Graph, a customized node object, etc.

in the second part of the class we will look at capabilities of 
kuzu graph database,  and how its interacts with networkx
